# iosBabyMonitor
It’s a fast-pacing society, making everyone’s carrying a heavy burden on life. This is especially the case to those fathers-to-be and mothers-to-be, because sometimes babies are really troublemakers although they’re cute and lovely. To those parents having babies, a sound sleep is rather precious due to the fact that babies may cry any time for any reasons (they may have just solved their physiological needs and cry for wet diaper, or they may have bumped into things or fallen over the bed and cry for the injury, or they may just cry for nothing). Anyway, parents will have to get up and go to the baby’s room to solve the problem. So, here comes our “Robotic Babysitter”. If the baby cries, the sound monitor would receive a high DB voice and therefore activate the program installed in the mobile, and the data from the moisture sensor put into the diaper would tell the parent if the diaper should be changed or not. However, if the data from the moisture includes no anomalies, then parents can use the camera to check if any accidents happens to decide whether they should get up or not.
