It’s a fast-pacing society, making everyone’s carrying a heavy burden on life. This is especially the case to those fathers-to-be and mothers-to-be, because sometimes babies are really troublemakers although they’re cute and lovely. They can start crying anytime for any reasons including suffering from a wet diaper, being hungry, feeling cold, falling off the bed, sometimes the babies cry just because they want to cry for no reason, once baby is crying, parents should go there and take a look to find what is happening. This really troubles probably every parent, and it’s pretty common in the real world. 
Our project is designed to save time, money for the parents, especially to those new and inexperienced parents, it will help them solve the problems more quickly, accurately and efficiently rather than rushing to the hospital every time when baby cries.
